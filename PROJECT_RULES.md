# Project Rules

- Preserve a calm, premium beach resort aesthetic
- Do not introduce new colors, fonts, or spacing outside defined tokens
- Mobile-first, responsive by default
- Animations must be subtle (fade, slight translate, slow parallax only)
- Reuse components; do not duplicate layout logic
- Do not redesign; match reference look and feel
- Optimize images and video for performance
